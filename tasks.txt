1. The function hideTheVisibleButton breaks if no element matching the query selector .visible is found. Add a try / catch statement to the function so that all of the contents are wrapped in the try block. Log the message "Unable to find any visible buttons" in the catch block that you've added and make sure that the interval now works correctly.

2. Instead of using displayRandomButton() to start the game, set an interval that will start a new go every second, using nextGo(). The error handling in task 1 is important here. If it is removed, the game will break with an error logged in the console.

3. Add a timer that will stop the game after two minutes by calling stopTheGame().

4. Finish the implementation of stopTheGame() so that it will stop the currently running interval, and hide the currently displayed game button.

5. Add a button "Start the game" next to the button "Stop the game". This new button will call startTheGame() when it is clicked. Finish implementing startTheGame() so that it sets an interval that runs the game. But make sure that clicking the button does nothing if a game is in progress, i.e. if there is an interval running!
